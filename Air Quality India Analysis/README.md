# 🌫️ Air Pollution in India — EDA Project using Python

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis** of air pollution trends across major Indian cities. The goal is to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize pollutant-level data to derive actionable insights using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Objective

Understand **pollution patterns**, identify the **most affected cities**, detect **seasonal/temporal trends**, and assess the **impact of different pollutants** like **PM10**, **PM2.5**, **NO₂**, **SO₂**, and **Ozone** over time.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Columns include:  
  `Date`, `City`, `Measure`, `Data Value`, `Air Quality`, `Time Period`, etc.
- Pollution indicators include: **PM10**, **NO2**, **PM2.5**, **Ozone**, **SO2**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Pandas** – Data cleaning, manipulation
- **NumPy** – Statistical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Trend & comparison plots
- **Seaborn** – Heatmaps & distribution visuals

## 📊 Key Business Questions Solved

1. What are the top 5 most polluted cities based on average **PM10** levels?
2. What is the **yearly trend** of **NO₂** in Delhi over the last decade?
3. Which city has shown the **highest improvement** in air quality?
4. How does the **average air quality index** vary across cities?
5. What is the **correlation between NO₂ and PM10** levels?
6. What is the **seasonal trend** in pollution levels?
7. Which cities reported "Very Poor" or "Severe" air quality most often?
8. What is the **monthly pollution pattern** in the most polluted city?
9. How does pollution vary on **weekdays vs weekends**?
10. Which **pollutants contribute most** to "Severe" air quality?

## 📌 Notable Insights / Findings

- **Delhi**, **Lucknow**, and **Kanpur** recorded the **highest average PM10 levels**.
- PM10 levels peak in **winter months**, especially **November–January**.
- There's a strong **positive correlation** between **NO₂** and **PM10**, indicating linked emission sources (e.g., vehicles, industry).
- Cities like **Mumbai** and **Kolkata** showed relatively better air quality metrics.
- Majority of "Severe" air quality cases were due to **PM10** and **PM2.5**.
- **Weekend vs weekday pollution** shows negligible difference—suggesting consistent pollution from industrial sources and not just traffic.
- **Some cities have improved** their pollution levels over time, while others (like Delhi) remain consistently high.
