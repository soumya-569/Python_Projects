## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

- **Top Launching Companies**: A handful of companies dominate total launches — SpaceX, NASA, and Roscosmos among the leaders.
- **Most Successful Missions**: SpaceX and NASA maintain high mission success percentages.
- **Launch Frequency**: The most launches occurred in the **2010s**, showing the recent boom in private and commercial space exploration.
- **Mission Cost**: Average costs vary drastically across companies, with some missions costing millions more.
- **Rocket Reusability**: Some rockets like **Falcon 9** are used repeatedly, increasing efficiency.
- **Location Advantage**: **Cape Canaveral** and **Baikonur Cosmodrome** were among the most used and successful launch sites.
- **Retired Rockets**: A high failure ratio was found among rockets now labeled as “Retired.”
- **Time of Day Impact**: Daytime launches were more frequent, possibly due to safety and visibility.
- **Decade Trends**: Significant growth in the number of missions was seen after the 2000s.
- **Most Expensive Missions**: These are often associated with deep space or crewed flights.
